## Aim

The goal of this project is to gather insights into any user's Netflix viewing history.

### Questions Asked

- Which Shows you binged watch?
- Which Genres you most like?
- Which seasons of particular shows are your favorite?

## Data Collection

I scraped the data from User's Netflix Account using Selenium Tool.

I will get the data and will dump into text file and will consider that as my raw data.

In raw data, every entry looks like

* "1" "4/9/18" "Friends: Season 8: \"The One with Monica's Boots\"" "https://www.netflix.com/title/70274176"


## Data Cleaning

```{r readRawFile, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```

Then, I will read the data from the raw text file and will create a Data frame for the viewing history. It will have following columns:

- Watching Date
- Titles
- Season
- Episodes
