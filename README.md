# NetflixProject
The goal of this project is to gather insights into any user's Netflix viewing history.

There is a video of how I am scraping the data using Selenium tool and it is in the /figs folder.
The raw text file is in the /data folder.
The .rmd file and the html slides generated are in the /doc folder.
The functions that I used are in the single file and the file is in the /R folder.

The shiny app is hosted at https://monicabansal.shinyapps.io/NetflixApp/ or can also be run locally and it is in the /output folder.

NetflixPresentation.Rmd file : It produces the ioslides presentation that I used in the class.
In this file, I take the raw data file from the /data folder and a clean file is generated at the end and is saved at the output folder where shiny app is, so that the shiny app can use the clean file.
